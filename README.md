# AutomationTestsExcersise
This project is coded in Cypress. In this particular test I checked the accessibility of Conatact us option and ability to submit the form on website automationexercise.com. I created two test case scenarios that might occur during the submitting the form. These tests help ensure that the system works well and can handle different cases smoothly.

To open the project, you need to follow this steps:

1. clone repository
2. use command in terminal: npm install
3. use command in terminal: npx cypress open
   
This test explores two distinct scenarios:

In the first scenario, a user successfully submits the form with the correct credentials, encountering no issues.
In the second scenario, a user uses incorrect credentials, triggering the appearance of an error message.
The objective is to ensure the successful passage of both tests, validating the system's ability to handle both correct and incorrect inputs.
